prototype website for medical appointment

Canadaâ€™s healthcare system is failing, so this inspired us to create this website. The fundamentals include:

Features and functionality: (the goal is boosting productivity, increasing efficiency with appointment booking to dampen the effects of staff shortages due to workload and pressure)

- Connected to medical records
- Protect from malicious sign ins (false identification)
- Connecting with healthcare professionals, there should be multiple ways to contact/ book an appointment, an online forum where you can ask questions and quicker answers where all medical professional can answer questions (reduce wait times and unnecessary appointments)
- **A feature to post a picture or document to provide further information/clarification, Online results for medical testing (to replace old fashioned paper documents to pick up)
- **Scan health card to retrieve existing data about medical history Qr code / barcode
- **Adding a map to find the closest health care facility to choose (filter for distance, type of medical appointment, help with the appointment process)

  ** means possible, but not implemented for sure (unsure if feasible given limited time and knowledge)
